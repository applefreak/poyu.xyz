# About Me

** *Hardware hacker, software tinkerer, Sometimes photographs.* **

Hi, my name is Poyu Chen, and I'm from Taiwan. Been in the States since early 2017.

Majored in Electronics Engineering, but loves to program the Web. IoT is my favorite subject now, so I get the best of two worlds.

I've interned at a wonderful company in Taiwan, [Tenten Creative](https://tenten.co) where I've learn a great lot about software development and client services.

I mostly write JavaScript, PHP, and manage Linux servers. I'm a Serverless enthusiast, Bitcoin evangelist, and Mandarin Chinese speaker!

Some of my work can be found here:

* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/~poyu)

If you're interested in contacting me, feel free to [shoot me an email](mailto:me@poyu.xyz).
