# About Me

** *Hardware hacker, software tinkerer, Sometimes photographs.* **

Hi, my name is Poyu Chen, and I'm from Taiwan. Moving to the States in 2017.

Majored in Electronics Engineering, but loves to program the Web. IoT is my favorite subject now, so I get the best of two worlds.

If you're interested in contacting me, feel free to [shoot me an email](mailto:me@poyu.xyz).
