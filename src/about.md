# About Me

** *Hardware hacker, software tinkerer, Sometimes photographs.* **

Hi, my name is Poyu Chen, and I'm from Taiwan. Been in the States since early 2017.

Majored in Electronics Engineering, but loves to program the Web.

I used to work at a wonderful company in Taiwan, [Tenten Creative](https://tenten.co) where I've learn a great lot about software development and client services.

Right now I'm employed full time at [Supplyframe Inc.](https://supplyframe.com/), the company that operates a site I absolutely loved, [Hackaday.com](https://hackaday.com/). Being able to work at this company makes me incredibly happy and fulfilling.

I mostly write JavaScript (Node.js & Browser), and manage Linux servers. I'm a Serverless enthusiast, ~~Bitcoin~~ Ethereum evangelist, and Mandarin Chinese speaker!

Some of my work can be found here:

* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/~poyu)

If you're interested in contacting me, feel free to [shoot me an email](mailto:me@poyu.xyz).
